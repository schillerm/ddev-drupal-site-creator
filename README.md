# DDev Drupal site creator
This project offers a bash script (sitemaker.sh) to assist Drupal developers in setting up a Drupal site locally using DDEV, justafish/ddev-drupal-core-dev add on, git and Python (yq).

Developers can use this script to easily set up to work on an issue in the issue queue (issue forks not patches).
This does not work in some edge cases, I am still testing on various issues and improving as I go.

Sites are set up in the way that I like, with the options/modules I personally find helpful. I hope others find it useful.

Remember to set the script to be executable before you run it sudo chmod +x sitemaker.sh.

See this guide for how to get started with DDev https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
