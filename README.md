# DDev Drupal site creator
This project offers a bash script (sitemaker.sh) to assist Drupal developers in setting up a Drupal site locally using DDEV, git and Python (Beautiful Soup and yq packages).

Developers can use this script to easily set up to work on an issue in the issue queue (issue forks not patches at this stage).

Remember to set the script to be executable before you run it sudo chmod +x sitemaker.sh.

See this guide for how to get started with DDev https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
